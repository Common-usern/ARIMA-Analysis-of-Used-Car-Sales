# ARIMA-Analysis-of-Used-Car-Sales

Used Car Sales ARIMA Analysis
This project analyzes used car sales data in the US using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) time series analysis model. The goal is to forecast future used car sales trends and identify patterns in the data.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, as well as several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager:


Data
The used car sales data used in this project comes from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle. The dataset contains information on over 370,000 used car sales in the US, including the make and model of the car, the year it was sold, and the sale price.

ARIMA Analysis
ARIMA is a powerful time series analysis model that can be used to forecast future trends in a dataset. In this project, we use the ARIMA model to analyze the used car sales data and identify patterns in the sales trends. The ARIMA model takes into account the previous values in the time series, as well as any trends and seasonal patterns that may exist in the data.

Results
The results of the ARIMA analysis are presented in the form of visualizations, including line plots and histograms. These visualizations can help us to understand the trends and patterns in the used car sales data, and to make predictions about future sales trends.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how the ARIMA model can be used to analyze time series data, such as used car sales data in the US. By identifying trends and patterns in the data, we can make informed predictions about future sales trends, which can be valuable for businesses and policymakers
